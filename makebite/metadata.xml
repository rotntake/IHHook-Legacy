  <Description># IHHook (Fork by rotntake)
This is a fork of IHHook, updated to work specifically with MGSV version 1.0.15.0.  
Original author: TinManTex. Forked and maintained by rotntake.

FoxString hook.  
Character, buddy, and vehicle change hooks.  
ihhook_config.lua (next to ihhook/dinput8 dll) - allows some startup settings of ihhook to be set.  
FNV Hash logging.
Ghidra scripts to export addresses, func defs, and a refactor and reduction of required steps to get hooks running.  

For MGSV version V1.15 in title screen and V1.0.15.0 in exe.
For Infinite Heaven r257  

Previously bundled with Infinite Heaven, IHHook has been split into a separate install and nexus page to isolate feedback and issues.

Lua C API support (mostly complete)  
Allows extending the MGSVs embedded lua via C.  
Does not have dynamic library support as mgsv lua is statically compiled, and running the mgsv lua state through a seperate distro of lua isn't desirable since the mgsv lua core is modified from default.  
However it is possible to compile lua C modules into IHHook.

## Further info
See IHHHook.h for some comments about the project.

## Thanks
To TinManTex for the original IHHook project.
And to the contributors of the original IHHook project for their work.
